## ⭐ Highlight

🔥 **Zero-shot Classifier**: Estimate buinding age from facade image without any training!  
🔥 **Facade Image Dataset**: FI-London combining facade images and building's attributs including builidng age and land use.  
⚠️ To test our classifier, the paid **OpenAI API Key** to call GPT-4 Vision is required.

## 🛠 Installation

## 🏢 FI-London

## 🕹️ Demo

## 🗓️ TODO

✅ FI-London v1 is released.  
✅ Age classifier is realsed.  
✅ Age claffication demo is realsed.  
🔲 Extend data size of FI-London.  
🔲 Land use classifier is on the way.  

## 📐 License

This project is released under MIT licence terms. All data in FI-London and codes of zero-shot classifier are free to download, use and share.

## ❤️ Acknowledge

This zero-shot classifier is based on [GPT-4 Vision](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/vision) by OpenAI. 

The Facade Image in London (FI-London) dataset is grounded in [Colourring Cities Research Programme](https://colouringcities.org/) by the Alan Turing Institude and [Colouring London](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Polly-Hudson/publication/333569102_Colouring_London_-A_Crowdsourcing_Platform_for_Geospatial_Data_Related_to_London's_Building_Stock_Winner_Best_Paper_GISRUK_2019/links/5cf510f2299bf1fb18539112/Colouring-London-A-Crowdsourcing-Platform-for-Geospatial-Data-Related-to-Londons-Building-Stock-Winner-Best-Paper-GISRUK-2019.pdf) by Hudson, P., et al. in 2018.

We thank for their great works.
