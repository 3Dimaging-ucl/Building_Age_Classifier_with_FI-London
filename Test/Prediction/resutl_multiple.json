[{"age": "2000-2019", "reason": "The building exhibits a modern architectural style with clean lines, large windows, and what appears to be fairly new materials, suggesting it was built between 2000 and 2019. No signs of very recent construction or design trends that are indicative of post-2020 development are visible.", "image_name": "6.jpg"}, {"age": "2000-2019", "reason": "The building in the image has a modern design with large, regular windows and clean brickwork, which suggests a style that became prevalent in the late 20th to the early 21st century. The overall design lacks the ornate features typical of earlier architectural periods, so it is more likely from the 2000-2019 epoch.", "image_name": "23.jpg"}, {"age": "1820-1839", "reason": "The building features a neoclassical architectural style with characteristics such as large columns with Corinthian capitals, a triangular pediment, and strong symmetry.
